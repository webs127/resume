- This Resume app is a simple, smooth and friendly application.

- The codebase uses the MVVM architectural pattern and it works by organizing code into different folders
for easy access or from separating the Ui from logic.

- The design of this app has two views, the splash and the landing view, the splash view is the first entry of
the app that gives title to the app while the landing view shows the contents of the app.

- I used the font_awesome_flutter package to get more icons that are not available in the material icons package and
i also used the url launcher package for opening websites.

- I would have added more views using bottomnavigationbar to make navigation more easy and would have also added a feature that
allows the user to add files to access anytime and store them in a server e.g firebase.

- I faced some challenges when i wanted to implement the changing of light and dark mode and also when i wanted to use the url launcher,
i solved the issue with critical thinking and stack overflow.
